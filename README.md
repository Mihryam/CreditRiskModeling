# CreditRiskModeling

Credit risk is like lending your books to your friends. Imagine you have a collection of books that you value alot, and your friends want to borrow them. When you lend your books to your friends, there's a chance they might not take good care of them or might not give them back.

Credit risk is like the chance that your friends might not return your books in the same condition, or they might forget to return them altogether. In the world of finance, when people or banks lend money to other people or businesses, they worry about whether they will get their money back or if they will get it back on time. This worry about getting their money back is what we call "credit risk." It's the risk that the person or business borrowing the money might not be able to pay it back as promised.

So, just like you think about whether your friends will return your books in good shape, banks and people think about whether they will get their money back when they lend it to others. That's credit risk!
